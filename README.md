# LMeterX

## 📋 Project Overview

LMeterX is a professional large language model performance testing platform that can be applied to model inference services based on large model inference frameworks (such as LiteLLM, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, LMDeploy, and others), and also supports performance testing for cloud services like Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and other major cloud providers. Through an intuitive Web interface, users can easily create and manage test tasks, monitor testing processes in real-time, and obtain detailed performance analysis reports, providing reliable data support for model deployment and performance optimization.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Universal Framework Support** - Compatible with mainstream inference frameworks (vLLM, LiteLLM, TensorRT-LLM) and cloud services (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud)
- **Full Model Compatibility** - Supports mainstream LLMs like GPT, Claude, and Llama with one-click stress testing
- **High-Load Stress Testing** - Simulates high-concurrency requests to accurately detect model performance limits
- **Multi-Scenario Coverage** - Supports streaming/non-streaming, supports text/multimodal/custom datasets<sup>![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-00C851?style=flat&labelColor=transparent)</sup>
- **Professional Metrics** - Core performance metrics including first token latency, throughput(RPS、TPS), and success rate
- **AI Smart Reports** - AI-powered performance analysis<sup>![NEW](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW-00C851?style=flat&labelColor=transparent)</sup>, multi-dimensional model comparison and visualization
- **Web Console** - One-stop management for task creation, stopping, status tracking, and full-chain log monitoring
- **Enterprise-level Deployment** - Docker containerization with elastic scaling and distributed deployment support

## 🏗️ System Architecture

LMeterX adopts a microservices architecture design, consisting of four core components:

1. **Backend Service**: FastAPI-based REST API service responsible for task management and result storage
2. **Load Testing Engine**: Locust-based load testing engine that executes actual performance testing tasks
3. **Frontend Interface**: Modern Web interface based on React + TypeScript + Ant Design
4. **MySQL Database**: Stores test tasks, result data, and configuration information

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Requirements
- Docker 20.10.0+
- Docker Compose 2.0.0+
- At least 4GB available memory
- At least 5GB available disk space

### One-Click Deployment (Recommended)

> **Complete Deployment Guide**: See [Complete Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on all deployment methods

Use pre-built Docker images to start all services with one click:

```bash
# Download and run one-click deployment script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MigoXLab/LMeterX/main/quick-start.sh | bash
```
### Usage Guide

1. **Access Web Interface**: Open http://localhost:8080
2. **Create Test Task**: Navigate to Test Tasks → Create Task, configure LLM API request information, test data, and request-response field mapping
   - 2.1 Basic Information: For `/chat/completions` API, you only need to configure API path, model, and response mode. You can also supplement the complete payload in request parameters.
   - 2.2 Data Payload: Select built-in text datasets/multimodal datasets as needed, or upload custom JSONL data files.
   - 2.3 Field Mapping: Configure the prompt field path in payload, and response data paths for model output content, reasoning_content fields, usage fields, etc. This field mapping is crucial for updating request parameters with datasets and correctly parsing streaming/non-streaming responses.
3. **API Testing**: In Test Tasks → Create Task, click the "Test" button in the Basic Information panel to quickly test API connectivity
   **Note**: For quick API response, it's recommended to use simple prompts when testing API connectivity.
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Navigate to Test Tasks → Logs/Monitoring Center to view full-chain test logs and troubleshoot exceptions
5. **Result Analysis**: Navigate to Test Tasks → Results to view detailed performance results and export reports
6. **Result Comparison**: Navigate to Model Arena to select multiple models or versions for multi-dimensional performance comparison
7. **AI Analysis**: In Test Tasks → Results/Model Arena, after configuring AI analysis service, support intelligent performance evaluation for single/multiple tasks

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variable Configuration

#### General Configuration
```bash
# ================= Database Configuration =================
DB_HOST=mysql           # Database host (container name or IP)
DB_PORT=3306            # Database port
DB_USER=lmeterx         # Database username
DB_PASSWORD=lmeterx_password  # Database password (use secrets management in production)
DB_NAME=lmeterx         # Database name

# ================= Frontend Configuration =================
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api  # Base API URL for frontend requests (supports reverse proxy)

# ================= High-Concurrency Load Testing Deployment Requirements =================
# When concurrent users exceed this threshold, the system will automatically enable multi-process mode (requires multi-core CPU support)
MULTIPROCESS_THRESHOLD=1000

# Minimum number of concurrent users each child process should handle (prevents excessive processes and resource waste)
MIN_USERS_PER_PROCESS=600

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
#   - When concurrency ≥ 1000, enabling multi-process mode is strongly recommended for performance.
#   - Multi-process mode requires multi-core CPU resources — ensure your deployment environment meets these requirements.

# ================= Deployment Resource Limits =================
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '2.0'       # Recommended minimum: 2 CPU cores (4+ cores recommended for high-concurrency scenarios)
      memory: 2G        # Memory limit — adjust based on actual load (minimum recommended: 2G)

```
