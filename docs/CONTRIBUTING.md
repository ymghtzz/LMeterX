## 🤝 Ways to Contribute

### Bug Fixes

You can directly post a Pull Request to fix typos in code or documents.

For code implementation bugs:
1. If the modification involves significant changes, create an issue first describing the error information and how to trigger the bug
2. Other developers will discuss with you and propose a proper solution
3. Post a pull request after fixing the bug and adding corresponding unit tests

### New Features or Enhancements

1. If the modification involves significant changes, create an issue to discuss with our developers and propose a proper design
2. Post a Pull Request after implementing the new feature or enhancement
3. Add corresponding unit tests for new functionality

### Documentation

- You can directly post a pull request to fix documents
- If you want to add new documentation, create an issue first to check if it is reasonable

### Other Contributions

- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring
- Community support
- Testing and feedback

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Node.js**: 18+
- **Docker**: 20.10.0+ (recommended)
- **Docker Compose**: 2.0.0+
- **MySQL**: 5.7+ (if not using Docker)

### Option 1: Docker Development Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LMeterX.git
cd LMeterX

# 2. Create a development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Check service status
docker-compose ps
```

### Option 2: Local Development Environment

#### Database Setup

```bash
# Install and start MySQL
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql

# macOS (using Homebrew):
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql

# Create database and user
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE lmeterx;
CREATE USER 'lmeterx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'lmeterx_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON lmeterx.* TO 'lmeterx'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Backend Development Environment

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file to configure database connection

# Start backend service
python app.py
```

#### Load Testing Engine Environment

```bash
cd st_engine

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start load testing engine
python app.py
```

#### Frontend Development Environment

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build:prod
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

cd LMeterX

# 3. Add upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DataEval/LuckyYC/LMeterX.git

# 4. Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Keep Code Updated

```bash
# Keep local code synchronized with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Switch to development branch and merge latest code
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge main
```

### 3. Commit Code

```bash
# Add modified files
git add .

# Commit code (follow commit conventions)
